# SafetyNet
### In progress! More updates on 7/27

One of the hardest parts of having mental health issues is having to ask for help. Millions of people suffer silently every year because they don't want to burden the people around them. My solution to this is SafetyNet. An app that enables users to ask for help if they need it -- or if they're unable to, the app will regularly prompt their SafetyNet of people to check up on them. If they feel uncomfortable asking their friends or family for help, it will connect them to a network of volunteers that match with them via a simple questionnaire. 

## Project Description

SafetyNet is an app that will connect people with mental health problems to a safety net of people ready to care for them. It will guide friends/family/volunteers alike through the process of helping someone cope in a healthy way. 


## Problem statement

Suicide is the second leading cause of death in adults aged 15-24. 90% of people who attempt suicide do not make a second attempt. People don't want to die, they just want their life as it is now to stop existing. According to this [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3683363/), social support is one of the most effective ways to fight against suicide.

## Solution

SafetyNet will give people access to a support network if they do not have one, or it helps their support system help in actually meaningful ways. It will have in-app messaging, alerts, and resources for the support system.

## User Experience

- user signs in and is prompt to choose whether they want to be a safety net or they need a safety net
- user sees a personal check in, why did you download this app?
- user answers general questions about themselves if they choose too (LGBTQA or not, Veteran or not, race, age)
- SafetyNet/support system users are asked if they know someone who asked them to be a part of their safety net, if so, they sign in and are able to message them
- Other SafetyNet users are asked whether they are satisfied with their current support system or if they would like to expand it
